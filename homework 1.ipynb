    "- When replacing each value in a list at index `i` with the sum of the values at indices `i-1` and `i`, it is essential to handle the boundary conditions of the list appropriately. Specifically, for the first element of the list (`Xsort[0]`), there is no previous element (`i-1`), meaning the operation cannot be applied to this element. Therefore, it should remain unchanged to avoid any logical inconsistency.\n",
    "- In this case, starting from the last element and moving backward ensures that each element is updated based on the value of its predecessor before any of the values change. This avoids cumulative effects that would occur if we iterated from the beginning of the list, where each modified element would affect subsequent calculations.\n",
    "- For example, consider the list `Xsort = [8, 9, 4, 5]`. Applying the transformation `Xsort[i] = Xsort[i] + Xsort[i-1]` backward from the last element ensures that the original values of the list are preserved for each step of the calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at `i = 3`:  \n",
    "   `Xsort[3] = Xsort[3] + Xsort[2] = 5 + 4 = 9`  \n",
    "   Updated list: `[8, 9, 4, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Move to `i = 2`:  \n",
    "   `Xsort[2] = Xsort[2] + Xsort[1] = 4 + 9 = 13`  \n",
    "   Updated list: `[8, 9, 13, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Move to `i = 1`:  \n",
    "   `Xsort[1] = Xsort[1] + Xsort[0] = 9 + 8 = 17`  \n",
    "   Updated list: `[8, 17, 13, 9]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- SO `Xsort[0]` is left unchanged since there is no element before it.\n",
    "- By iterating backward, the values that need to be summed are always in their original, unmodified state. This prevents any issues with cumulative sums that would arise if we modified earlier elements before they are used in subsequent sums. If we had started from the beginning, every time we modified an element, it would affect the summation of the following elements, resulting in incorrect cumulative sums.\n",
    "- `Avoiding Negative Indexing`: Python‚Äôs negative indexing can access elements from the end of the list, but it's not relevant when summing adjacent elements. Therefore, we should avoid circular logic, which might lead to unintended outcomes (e.g., summing `Xsort[0]` with `Xsort[-1]` would create a link between the first and last elements, which is not desired in this linear operation).\n",
    "- `Special Case for Xsort[0]`: If we apply the summation logic (i.e., Xsort[i] = Xsort[i] + Xsort[i-1]) to Xsort[0], it would result in an incorrect operation. Specifically, Xsort[0] would be summed with Xsort[-1], which might already be modified due to previous summations. This creates an inconsistency where Xsort[0] is not treated the same as other indices. For all other indices, the summation only involves adjacent unmodified elements. Hence, Xsort[0] should remain unchanged, or at the very least, its update should not involve a circular reference to Xsort[-1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first element remains unchanged.\n",
    "- Each element is updated based on its unmodified predecessor.\n",
    "- No cumulative effect interferes with the correctness of the summation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this logic, the operation remains consistent and reversible without introducing any flawed logic."

    "**18**: The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle loosely based on the American television game show \"Let's Make a Deal\" and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The puzzle can be stated as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? <br>\n",
    "+info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While intuitively your guess might be that the chances of winning the car is 1/3 independently of the choice to switch doors or not. Howewver, the odds of winning if you switch doors are 2/3 and greater than if you decide not to switch. While there are theoretical solutions to this problem that allow us to estimate the correct odds of winning in each scenario -- switching or not doors -- an alternative way to proof such outcome is through computer simulations. That is the goal of this exercise, to write the necessary components to simulate the Monty Hall problem and validate the theoretical results through simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, start by implementing a function that simulates one instance of the Monty Hall problem. \n",
    "In that sense, write a function called MontyHall that accepts **one argument**:\n",
    "- A boolean (True/False, or 1/0) that specifies if the player switches doors or not (after the host has opened his door, which contains a goat).\n",
    "The function should return True if the player wins the car or False if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, for the function to reproduce the contest it needs to consider and perform some actions, such as:\n",
    "- Set up the game, that is, create the necessary variables to store the information about three doors and what they have behind, as well as an indicator to track the choice of the player.\n",
    "- Given the initial choice of the player, simulate the opening of one of the two remaining doors that contains a goat.\n",
    "- Given the last two doors left, simulate if the player wants to switch or not his/her choice given their strategy (defined by the input boolean argument of the function).\n",
    "- Output the result, if the contestant correctly guesses which door hides the car or if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function MontyHall should simulate one instance of the contest given the choice of the player (to switch or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal is to understand, statistically, which action leads to the highest probability of winning.** <br>\n",
    "*Note: You should use the library random to solve this exercise.*"

    "When we repeat the scenario many times (thousands of times) for each of the two possible situations, we always get a result similar to this (approximately a 67% win rate when switching and a 33% win rate when not switching). To justify this, let's use the example of 100 doors. If I choose one door and then the host eliminates the other 98, all containing goats, we have the option of sticking with the one we initially chose or switching to the remaining door. In this scenario, our mind should switch instantly because there's no way we got it right on the first try. It's more likely that out of the 99 remaining doors, the one not open for the host (who know where is the car) is the one with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we don't have a 50/50% chance of winning when the host opens one door, and we can choose to switch or stay with our first choice. If we switch to the closed door, we have a 2/3 (0.666667) chance of winning. The 1/3 option (loosing one) is the scenario where both of the remaining doors have goats. In the other 2/3 scenarios: we choose door one, the host opens door two with the goat, and we decide to go for door three, which has the car. The other scenario is that we choose one door, the host opens door three, and we switch to door two, which has the car. We can switch the order of the doors, but the chances remain the same. When we decide not to switch, we always have a 1/3 (0.3333...) chance (since we randomly choose 1 out of 3 doors)."
